## Credits
This web app is based on the awesome 
[React Boilerplate](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate) 
by Max Stoiber. It really helped me understand the concepts of 
scalable JavaScript development based on technologies like..
* React
* Redux
* Reselect
* React Intl
* Redux Saga
* Webpack, Babel, HMR, etc.

Even more credit goes to the 
[Facebook Chat API](https://github.com/Schmavery/facebook-chat-api)
devs, who actually make the whole project possible.
