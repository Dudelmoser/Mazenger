## Bugs

### Reproducable
* login with different credentials doesn't auto-clear the cache
* chat input switches from uncontrolled to controlled
(results in weird overlay effect)

### Not reproducable
* messages sent twice
* own and foreign messages switch sides 
(probably due to a bug in the selectMessage or isOwn selector)

### Fixed
* ~~thread history doesn't auto scroll~~
* ~~self-chat caused by wrong thread IDs in typing events~~
* ~~react-easy-emoji null pointer after clearing the cache~~
